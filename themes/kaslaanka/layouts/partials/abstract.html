The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday life underscores a growing opportunity for human-centric AI approaches in sociotechnical systems (STSs). These systems comprise stakeholders (here, users) and agents working toward societal objectives. The success of an STS depends on its users acting in a way that promotes the values that motivate the STS and enable effective resource sharing.
In other words, we posit that prosociality in the nature of users' attitudes and behaviors is essential to the success of an STS. Prosociality simply means having attitudes and exhibiting behaviors that help others. 
<br><br>
Our conception of prosociality provides a counterpoint to the more widely studied economic models of resource sharing and collaboration. Whereas traditional approaches seek to determine incentives that lead users to behave in a way that advances societal objectives, we consider models of users' values and empathy to persuade them toward prosocial behaviors. This approach averts the key limitations of economic models that they are (1) not applicable in many settings (as in helping food-insecure people obtain food) and (2) even when applicable, they are often not effective (because people don't behave like economists expect).
<br><br>
But how can we, as system designers, promote prosociality among users?
<br><br>
This dissertation addresses the challenge of promoting prosociality in STSs dealing with societal resource allocation. 
Encouraging prosociality requires well-designed interventions that shift user behavior toward helping others. This research focuses on persuasion using AI to make prosocial actions easier and more appealing. 
<br><br>
Despite advances in personalization and persuasion, a significant gap remains in understanding the underlying cognitive processes that shape decision-making and behavior in sociotechnical systems. Traditional approaches to persuasion expect explicit data and surface-level behavioral cues and largely downplay the psychological variability driving a user's action selection. 
<br><br>
This research proposes a novel approach to facilitating effective behavior changes by developing adaptive agents that incorporate cognitive insights to deliver personalized and persuasive interventions aligned with user needs. Its overarching objective is to design a user-centric framework that enhances user experience and societal benefit by leveraging insights from human cognition. This involves (1) modeling a user's cognitive states and how they change, and (2) capturing their influence on decision-making to provide effective persuasive strategies. Thus, we study three aspects of this problem.
<br><br>
First, we explore the potential of triggering empathy and inducing prosocial behavior in food bank operations. We investigate how persuasive messages and empathy can influence user (consumer) decisions while maintaining equitable allocation by recommending substitutes that consider both consumer preferences and provider (food bank) benefits. This model learns a dynamic environment where the availability of food and consumer preferences change continually. Our approach applies reinforcement learning to optimize both consumer satisfaction and provider benefits. We also investigate how persuasive messages and empathy can influence user decision-making by conducting a human study. Our proposed model not only accounts for consumer needs but also induces shifts in preference. Through this study, we demonstrate that incorporating dynamic objectives can potentially improve outcomes for both consumers and food banks, enhancing overall social well-being.

Second, we study the problems of cognitive accessibility of mobile technologies and their impact on the digital divide. Older adults face some challenges, such as mild cognitive decline, in greater numbers than the overall population. We evaluate the current accessibility guidelines and the characteristics of the older adult population experiencing mild cognitive decline by analyzing mobile app reviews. We assess the points where older adults encounter barriers while using existing mobile apps. We state that applying AI to the design process has the potential to revolutionize the user experience that adapts to user needs. By proposing a conceptual framework that leverages AI to enhance design principles, this study aims to enable more inclusive and personalized user experiences for older adults and help them engage more with advanced technologies. Our work contributes to understanding cognitive processes that can enhance user experience and benefit various user groups to engage with technology.

Third, we consider contextual persuasion, particularly in relation to prosocial behavior, by examining how the interplay between dynamic cognitive states and external factors shapes observable actions. By modeling the relationship between latent cognitive states and observable behavior, we seek to develop adaptive agents capable of improving persuasive effectiveness. Our approach emphasizes the importance of understanding individual variability in cognitive processes and action choices. It highlights that interventions to drive long-term behavioral change must not come from uniform strategies but from resonating with each user's motivations and values.
<br><br>
By employing methodologies such as reinforcement learning, agent-based simulations, and human studies, this research contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of interaction and persuasion, particularly in prosocial contexts, fostering meaningful and sustainable behavior change.
