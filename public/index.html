        The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday life underscores a growing opportunity for human-centric AI approaches to advance personalization and foster effective behavior changes. Despite advances in personalization and persuasion, a significant gap remains in understanding the underlying cognitive processes that shape decision-making and behavior. Traditional approaches to persuasion expect explicit static data and surface-level behavior cues and largely downplay the psychological variability driving over user's action selection. 
        <br><br>
        This research addresses a novel approach to facilitate effective behavior changes by developing adaptive agents that incorporate cognitive insights to deliver personalized and persuasive interventions aligning with user needs. Its overarching objective is to design a user-centric framework that enhances user experience and societal benefit by leveraging insights from human cognition. This involves (1) modeling a user's cognitive states and how they change and (2) capturing their influence on decision-making to provide effective persuasive strategies. Thus, we study three aspects of this problem.
        <br><br>
        First, we explore the potential of triggering empathy and inducing prosocial behavior in food bank operations. We investigate how persuasive messages and empathy can influence user (consumer) decisions while maintaining equitable allocation by recommending substitutes by considering consumer preferences and provider (food bank) benefits. This model learns a dynamic environment where available food and consumer preferences change. Our approach employees reinforcement learning to optimize maximizing consumer satisfaction and provider benefit. We also investigate how persuasive messages and empathy can influence changing decisions via conducting human study. Our proposed model not only accounts for consumer needs but also induces preference shifts. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic objectives can potentially improve outcomes for both consumers and food banks, enhancing overall social well-being.
        <br><br>
        Second, we study the problems of cognitive accessibility of mobile technologies and its impact on the digital divide. Older adults often faces unique challenges, such as mild cognitive decline. We explore the current accessibility guidelines and the characteristics of the older adult population experiencing mild cognitive decline through analyzing mobile app reviews. We assess the points where older adults experience barriers while using existing mobile apps. We state that applying AI to design process has the potential to revolutionize user experience that adapt to user needs. By proposing a conceptual framework that leverages AI to enhance design principles, this study aims to enable more inclusive and personalized user experiences for older adults and help them engage more with advanced technologies. Our work contributes to understanding cognitive processes can enhance user experience and benefit to various user groups to be engaged with technology. 
        <br><br>
        Third, we consider contextual persuasion, especially for prosocial behavior, delving into the dynamics of human cognitive states and their impact on observable behavior. We aim to create adaptive agents that deliver improved persuasion by modeling the relationship between mental states and behavioral actions. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding individual variability in cognitive processes to drive long-term behavioral change resonating with individual values.
        <br><br>
        By employing methodologies such as reinforcement learning, agent-based simulations, and human study, this research contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of interaction and persuasion, in particular in prosocial contexts, fostering meaningful and sustainable behavior change.
