        The integration of advanced technology into everyday life underscores the growing importance of human-centric approaches, particularly in advancing personalization and fostering effective interaction with AI to nudge behavior changes. Despite technological advancements in personalization and persuasion, there remains a significant gap in deep understanding of the underlying cognitive processes that shape decision-making and behavior. Traditional approaches to persuasion primarily rely on explicit static data and surface-level behavior cues and often ignore the deeper psychological variability driving the dynamics of individual actions. This thesis addresses the limitations by developing adaptive systems that integrate cognitive insights to deliver personalized and persuasive interventions aligning with individual needs, preferences, and values. The overarching objective is to design a user-centric framework that enhances the personalized experience and persuasiveness of the systems by leveraging insights from human cognition. This involves understanding and modeling dynamic cognitive states and exploring their influence on decision-making to provide persuasive strategies that resonate with intrinsic values.

Meal explores the potential of triggering empathy and inducing prosocial behavior in food bank operations. We investigate how persuasive messages and empathy can influence consumer decisions while maintaining equitable allocation by recommending substitutes by considering consumer preferences and provider benefits. We propose a model that learns a dynamic environment where available food and consumer preferences change. The findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic objectives can potentially improve outcomes for both consumers and food banks, enhancing overall social well-being.

We investigate the problems of cognitive accessibility of mobile technologies and its impact on the digital divide. We explore the current accessibility guidelines and the characteristics of the older adult population experiencing mild cognitive decline through mobile app reviews. By opposing a conceptual framework that leverages AI to enhance design principles, this study aims to enable more inclusive and personalized user experiences for older adults and help them engage more with advanced technologies. 
<br><br>
Lastly, the research also focuses on contextual persuasion, especially for prosocial behavior, delving into the dynamics of human cognitive states and their impact on observable behavior. We aim to create adaptive systems that deliver improved persuasion by modeling the relationship between mental states and behavioral actions. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding individual variability in cognitive processes to drive long-term behavioral change resonating with individual values.
<br><br>
By employing methodologies such as reinforcement learning, agent-based simulations, and human study, this thesis contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of interaction and persuasion, in particular in prosocial contexts, fostering meaningful and sustainable behavior change.
